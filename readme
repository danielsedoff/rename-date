rename-date

rename-date is a small utility that integrates into 
Windows Explorer context menus and adds the current date 
to the files you have selected.

Example:

(file.txt) --> right-click --> rename-date --> (20170201 file.txt)

To install this utility, use install.bat.
You need administrator rights to do so.
Right-click on install.bat and choose 'Run as Administrator'.

After this, a directory called C:\rename-date will be created.

To uninstall this utility, use uninstall.bat. 
You also need administrator rights to launch it.

If you try to uninstall it without administrator rights, 
the context menus will not disappear. In this case 
please reinstall rename-date and uninstall it again 
by choosing 'Run as Administrator'.
