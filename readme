rename-date

rename-date is a small utility that integrates into Windows Explorer context menus and adds the current date to the files you have selected.

Example:

(file.txt) --> right-click --> rename-date --> (20170201 file.txt)

To install this utility, use install.bat.
You need administrator rights to do so.
Right-click on install.bat and choose 'Run as Administrator'.

After this, a directory called C:\rename-date will be created.

To uninstall this utility, use uninstall.bat. 
You also need administrator rights to launch it.

Warning: If you try to uninstall it without administrator rights, the context menus will not disappear. In this case please reinstall rename-date and uninstall it again by choosing 'Run as Administrator'.
